# punisher_for_scmmrs
 Script run requests to fake scammer site and fill fake forms.  I didn't hack anything, didn't do anything that a normal person couldn't have done.  No hacks, exploits, vulnerabilities, break-ins. Every action I took was publicly available  to me and everyone else that went to scam site.
